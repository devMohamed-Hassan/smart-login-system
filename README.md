# Smart Login System 

This project is a **Smart Login System** that allows users to register and log in using their email and password. The system uses **localStorage** to store user data, ensuring that information is preserved even after the page is refreshed. The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for a responsive design.

## Features
